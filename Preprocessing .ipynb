It's been a challenging journey, and it's commendable that you've tried various approaches like visualization, positive thinking, and medication to manage your symptoms. However, it's clear that these methods haven't been effective for you. It's essential to acknowledge that mental health issues can be complex and multifaceted, and what works for one person might not work for another. Today, we're going to approach this differently. We're going to identify a specific concern related to your mental health that you'd like to work on, and we'll break it down into manageable steps. We'll define the problem as a feeling of being overwhelmed by your thoughts and emotions, and we'll set realistic goals for managing this feeling. We'll explore the root causes of this confusion, such as past traumas, current stressors, and any underlying psychological conditions. We'll also examine your thought patterns and emotional responses to these triggers, and we'll develop strategies to challenge and reframe negative thoughts. This process is called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), and it's designed to help you face your challenges more effectively by changing the way you think and feel about them. Let's begin by discussing the specific incidents or concerns that have been contributing to your feelings of confusion and chaos. We can explore these further and come up with strategies to help you manage them.\"}"

Output: If everyone thinks you're worthless, then maybe you need to find new people to hang out with.Seriously, the social context in which a person lives is a big influence in self-esteem.Otherwise, you can go round and round trying to understand why you're not worthless, then go back to the same crowd and be knocked down again.There are many inspirational messages you can find in social media. \\xa0Maybe read some of the ones which state that no person is worthless, and that everyone has a good purpose to their life.Also, since our culture is so saturated with the belief that if someone doesn't feel good about themselves that this is somehow terrible.Bad feelings are part of living. \\xa0They are the motivation to remove ourselves from situations and relationships which do us more harm than good.Bad feelings do feel terrible. \\xa0 Your feeling of worthlessness may be good in the sense of motivating you to find out that you are much better than your feelings today.\""
